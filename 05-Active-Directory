Comprehensive IT Troubleshooting and Active Directory Guide

1. Hardware Troubleshooting

Windows:

Use Device Manager (devmgmt.msc) to check device status and update drivers.

Run Windows Memory Diagnostic (mdsched.exe) for RAM issues.

Check Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) for hardware-related logs.

Use chkdsk /f to scan and fix disk errors.

Monitor hardware performance using Task Manager and Resource Monitor.

Linux:

Use lshw or dmidecode to check hardware specifications.

lsblk to list connected storage devices.

dmesg for kernel hardware logs.

memtest86+ to test RAM integrity.

smartctl -a /dev/sdX to check hard disk health.


2. Software Troubleshooting

Windows:

Run sfc /scannow (System File Checker) to fix corrupted system files.

Use DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth for system component repair.

Check Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) for application errors.

Boot into Safe Mode to isolate software conflicts.

Linux:

Check logs in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages.

Use strace to trace program execution.

Run fsck /dev/sdX to repair file system errors.

Use dpkg --configure -a or apt --fix-broken install to fix package issues.


3. Networking

Windows:

ipconfig /all to check IP configuration.

ping, tracert, and nslookup for network testing.

Use netsh for advanced network configuration.

Linux:

ifconfig or ip a to check IP details.

ping, traceroute, and dig for network diagnostics.

nmcli or nmtui for managing network connections.


4. BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) / Kernel Panic

Windows:

Analyze crash dumps using WinDbg or BlueScreenView.

Run sfc /scannow and chkdsk /f.

Check system logs in Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc → Windows Logs → System).

Linux:

View logs using journalctl -xe or dmesg | tail.

Boot into rescue mode and check /var/log/syslog.

Use fsck to fix file system corruption.


5. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

Windows:

Use ipconfig /renew to request a new IP.

Configure the DHCP server via DHCP Manager in Windows Server.

Linux:

View DHCP leases using cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases.

Restart DHCP client: sudo systemctl restart networking.


6. DNS (Domain Name System)

Windows:

nslookup domain.com to check DNS resolution.

ipconfig /flushdns to clear DNS cache.

Linux:

dig example.com or host example.com for DNS lookup.

systemd-resolve --flush-caches to clear DNS cache.


7. VPN (Virtual Private Network)

Windows:

Configure VPN in Settings → Network & Internet → VPN.

Connect via command line using rasphone -d "VPN_Name".

Linux:

Use openvpn --config myvpn.ovpn for OpenVPN connections.

Connect with NetworkManager: nmcli connection up myvpn.


8. LAN (Local Area Network)

ping <IP> to test connectivity.

Windows: netstat -an to check active connections.

Linux: ss -tunlp to view network sockets.


9. Active Directory (AD) Basics

What is Active Directory?

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service by Microsoft for managing users, computers, and resources within a Windows domain.

 Core AD Features:

 Centralized authentication and authorization.

 Group Policy for enforcing security.

 Organizational Units (OUs) for logical structuring.

 Replication across domain controllers.


Common AD Commands:

Task                                     Command

List Domain Controllers                 nltest /dclist:yourdomain.com

List Organizational Units               dsquery ou

Check Global Catalog Servers            nltest /dclist:yourdomain.com /GC

Check FSMO Role Holders                 netdom query fsmo


10. Group Policies (GPO)

Windows:

Use gpedit.msc to configure local policies.

Apply policy updates with gpupdate /force.

Linux (Similar Policies with PAM & UFW):

visudo for managing sudo permissions.

/etc/security/limits.conf for resource restrictions.


11. NTFS vs FAT File Systems

NTFS: Supports permissions, encryption, and large files.

FAT32: Universal compatibility but limited to 4GB file size.


12. Port Numbers

Service

Port Number

HTTP : 80

HTTPS : 443

SSH : 22

RDP : 3389

DNS : 53

SMTP : 25


13. Virtual Memory

Windows: Uses pagefile.sys.

Linux: Uses swap space (swapon -s).


14. Hosts File Location

Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Linux: /etc/hosts
